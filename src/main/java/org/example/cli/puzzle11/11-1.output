 I have implemented the solution for Day 11 Part 2 in src/main/java/org/example/cli/puzzle11/Puzzle11Part2.java.

  The solution:
   1. Parses the input into a directed graph.
   2. Identifies critical nodes: svr (start), out (end), dac, and fft (intermediate waypoints).
   3. Calculates paths by summing two mutually exclusive cases (due to the DAG nature of the graph):
       * Paths traversing svr -> dac -> fft -> out.
       * Paths traversing svr -> fft -> dac -> out.
   4. Counts paths for each segment using DFS with memoization and multiplies them to get the total combinations for each case.

  Testing:
   * A test case using the provided example from Part 2 was created in src/test/java/org/example/cli/puzzle11/Puzzle11Part2Test.java and passes (result: 2).
   * The solution was run against the full input file 11.input.

  Result:
  The total number of paths from svr to out visiting both dac and fft is 473,741,288,064,360.

  You can run the solution using:

   1 java -cp target/classes org.example.cli.puzzle11.Puzzle11Part2
  Or run the tests:
   1 mvn test -Dtest=Puzzle11Part2Test
