 I have implemented the solution for Day 5 in src/main/java/org/example/cli/puzzle5/Puzzle5.java.

  The solution parses the range definitions and the list of ingredient IDs, then checks each ID to see if it falls within any of the valid ranges.

  Execution Result:
   1 Number of fresh ingredients: 517

  You can run the solution using the following command:

   1 javac src/main/java/org/example/cli/puzzle5/Puzzle5.java && java -cp src/main/java org.example.cli.puzzle5.Puzzle5
