 I have successfully implemented the solution for Day 6: Trash Compactor in Java.

  Key Actions:
   1. Analyzed Input: Confirmed the input format is a grid of numbers with an operator row at the bottom, where problems are separated by empty vertical columns.
   2. Implemented Solution: Created src/main/java/org/example/cli/puzzle6/Puzzle6.java.
       * It reads the input as a grid.
       * It identifies vertical strips (blocks) corresponding to each problem by finding empty columns.
       * It parses the numbers and the operator (+ or *) for each block.
       * It calculates the result for each block using BigInteger to avoid overflow and sums them up.
   3. Refactored for Testing: Refactored the core logic into a static solve(List<String>) method.
   4. Verified:
       * Created src/test/java/org/example/cli/puzzle6/Puzzle6Test.java to test against the example provided in the puzzle description. The test passes.
       * Ran the solution against the actual 6.input file.

  Result:
  The calculated Grand Total for the provided input is: 6757749566978

  To Run:
  You can run the solution using Maven:
   1 mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.cli.puzzle6.Puzzle6"

  Or run the tests:
   1 mvn test -Dtest=Puzzle6Test
