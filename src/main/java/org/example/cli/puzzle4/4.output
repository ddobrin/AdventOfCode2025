 The puzzle for Day 4 has been implemented in src/main/java/org/example/cli/puzzle4/Puzzle4.java.

  The solution reads the grid from 4.input, iterates through each paper roll (@), counts its neighbors, and applies the accessibility rule (fewer than 4 neighbors).

  Plan Executed:
   1. Read Input: Loaded the character grid from src/main/java/org/example/cli/puzzle4/4.input.
   2. Traverse Grid: Iterated through every coordinate in the grid.
   3. Check Neighbors: For each paper roll (@), examined the 8 adjacent cells.
   4. Validate: Counted how many neighbors were also paper rolls. If the count was < 4, it was marked as accessible.
   5. Output: Printed the total count of accessible rolls.

  Test Result:
  Running the main method produced the following output:
   1 Accessible rolls: 1344
