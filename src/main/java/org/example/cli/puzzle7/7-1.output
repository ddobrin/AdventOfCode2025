 Task completed. I have implemented the solution for "Day 7: Laboratories" in src/main/java/org/example/cli/puzzle7/Puzzle7.java and verified it with tests in src/test/java/org/example/cli/puzzle7/Puzzle7Test.java.

  Results:
   - Part 1: 1642 (Matches the provided answer)
   - Part 2: 47274292756692

  Implementation Details:
   - Part 1: Simulates the beam path row by row using a Set to track active beam columns, counting every time a beam hits a splitter ('^').
   - Part 2: Simulates "quantum" beams using a Map to track the number of active timelines at each column. When a beam hits a splitter, the count is duplicated to both new paths. Completed timelines (exiting the grid) are accumulated.

  You can verify the solution by running the main method:
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.cli.puzzle7.Puzzle7"

  Or running the tests:
  mvn test -Dtest=Puzzle7Test
