The "Laboratories" puzzle (Day 7) has been implemented and solved.

  Solution Overview
  The puzzle involves simulating a tachyon beam falling through a manifold containing empty space (.) and splitters (^). The beam starts at S and splits when encountering ^, creating new beams to the left and right.

  Key Logic:
   - Simulation: processed the grid row by row.
   - State: Maintained a set of active column indices for the current row.
   - Splitting: When a beam hits a splitter (^), the split counter is incremented, and new beams are generated at col-1 and col+1 for the next row (since adjacent splitters ^^ do not exist in the input, intra-row cascades are impossible).
   - Merging: The use of a Set handles beam merging naturally (multiple beams entering the same cell count as one active beam).

  Verification
   1. Unit Test: A JUnit test (Puzzle7Test.java) was created using the example from the puzzle description. It passes, confirming the logic yields 21 splits.
   2. Full Input: The solution was run against 7.input.
       - Result: 1642
